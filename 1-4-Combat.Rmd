## Combat Fundamentals

In Square Fireballs, a combat encounter represents a short, violent conflict between an adventuring party of Player Characters and a group of Monsters controlled by the Game Master. 

<div class="tip">**Tip**:Note that we use **Monsters** as shorthand for "bad guys", and it is perfectly possible to have a Monster team composed of non-monstruous mundane characters like human bandits or wolves. Or they can also be, you know, many-eyed tentacled abominations.</div>

In combat, each character (whether a Player Character or a Monster) takes **turns** to carry out **actions** such as moving, attacking enemies, or healing or assisting allies. Some actions succeed automatically, whereas others require the character to make a successful die roll. For example, movement through normal terrain is resolved automatically, with the player stating the character's movement path and changing the character's position accordingly. On the other hand, attacking requires the character to roll against the enemy's defense to determine if the attack hits, and then rolling again to determine the damage dealt by the attack.

<div class="tip">**Tip**: Generally, to make a die roll in the game a player rolls a 20-sided die (aka. d20), adds the appropriate bonus from their Character Sheet, plus any modifiers that apply, and tries to beat a target number, like a Check Difficulty or an enemy defense stat. Another common type of die roll is the damage roll, which is made after hitting with an attack. In a damage roll, the player rolls several dice of a type determined by the attack, adds a damage bonus and uses the total as the amount of inflicted damage.</div>

The goal of a combat encounter is incapacitate all enemy characters, typically by inflicting enough damage to reduce them below 0 Hit Points. A combat can also end when either the monsters or the Player Characters decide to flee.





## The Combat Map



### Distances

The following figure illustrates how distances work. The number in each square represent the distance between the Wizard and that square.

![Map distances](figures/I_1_1_Distances.png)

This figure shows some specific examples of squares that are 1,2,3,4, and 5 units away from the Wizard

![Map distance examples](figures/I_1_2_Distances2.png)

### Lines

Due to the way that distances are defined in our maps, certain geometrical elements like lines are not as straightforward as one would expect. In the game map, a Line is:

- one of the shortest paths between two points (note that there can be several paths that meet this requirement!)
- composed of up to two straight segments: one in the horizontal or vertical direction, and another in a diagonal direction. 

For any two points in the map, there will be one or two Lines that meet this definition.

This figure shows the simplest types of lines, composed of a single horizontal (1), vertical (2) or diagonal (3, 4) segment. Note that when two points can be joined by a single-segment Line, there will only be a single Line between these points.

![Line definition](figures/I_2_1_Lines.png)

This figure shows examples of two-segment lines. When two points can be joined by a two-segment line, there will always be two such lines between these points.

## Combat Sequence

The combat sequence can be summarized as follows:

- Before the start of combat, determine the location of all characters in the combat map.
- The GM arranges all monsters in the encounter into monster groups.
- All characters start combat in Total Defense.
- At the start of combat, all characters roll initiative to determine the order in which they act.
- Each round, all characters take turns in order of initiative.
- Combat ends when either all PCs or all monsters are knocked out or have run away.

Definitions:

- Initiative Value: Value used to determine acting order in combat. Characters with higher initiative act first.
- Group of monsters: Several monsters that share the same Initiative Value
- Combat turn: Turn of action for a single PC or group of monsters. A character can usually take a Minor Action, a Move Action, and a Standard Action per turn.
- Combat round: Sequence of turns for all characters in an encounter. Once all characters have acted, a new round begins.

### Grouping monsters

Unlike PCs, who roll for initiative individually, monsters are often grouped together to speed up the flow of combat. GMs have freedom to arrange monster groups as they see fit, but they should apply the following guidelines:

- Each monster group should be composed of identical monsters, or monsters with the same Initiative  modifier.
- Each combat should have between 2 and 4 monster groups, if possible.

### Defending at the start of combat

At the start of combat, and before any character takes an action, all characters use Total Defense as a Free Reaction, unless they are Surprised (see [Ambushes] below):

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
df_total_defense <- read_df_power() %>% dplyr::filter(Name=='Total Defense') %>% clean_df_power()
df_total_defense$htm_power %>% cat()
```

<div class="tip">**Tip**: This rule is meant to compensate for the advantages of going first in combat. Characters that haven't acted yet will be much harder to hit. Remember, if your character is acting early in combat and you can find no favorable attacks, there is no shame in moving and using Total Defense yourself!</div>

#### Ambushes

By default, at the start of a combat encounter all combatants are ready and aware of their opponents. However, it is possible for a group of characters to sneak on their enemies and catch them totally or partially by surprise - we call this an Ambush. There are two types of Ambush, depending on their degree of success:

- Total Ambush: All enemies start combat Surprised.
- Partial Ambush: Some enemies start combat Surprised.

Status | Downgrade | Effects
| - | - | --------
| Surprised | No Downgrade | - Cannot use Full Defense at the start of combat. <br />- Condition ends when attacked. <br />- When this character would take the turn, they use Full Defense, end the turn, and are no longer considered Surprised.

A character that is not surprised can warn Surprised allies with the Raise the Alarm maneuver:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
df_alarm <- read_df_power() %>% dplyr::filter(Name=='Raise the Alarm') %>% clean_df_power()
df_alarm$htm_power %>% cat()
```

Use the rules in the [Skills] chapter to determine whether the PCs can successfully ambush their enemies... or are ambushed by them.

<div class="tip">**Tip**: Characters carrying out an ambush have a significant advantage, but this is not quite the same as getting a free turn. Try to focus your fire on a few targets, and be aware that an enemy raising the alarm may ruin your plans.</div>

<div class="tip">**GM Tip**: Ambushes should be relatively rare. Unless the PCs are unusually stealthy, or the monsters are extraordinarily oblivious, assume that an ambush is a hard task that will fail most of the time.</div>


### Rolling Initiative

At the start of combat, each PC or group of monsters Rolls Initiative as follows:

```
Initiative Value = 1d20 + Initiative Modifier
```

After rolling initiative, put all PCs and groups of monsters in a list, ordered by Initiative Value (higher values first). This list will be used as reference to determine the order of actions for this combat encounter. In case of a tie, sort the characters tied in initiative as follows:

- Try to alternate PCs and monsters: If PCs and monsters are tied for the same initiative value, and the character acting right before that initiative value is PC, the monsters win the tie. If the character acting right before that initiative value is a monster, the PCs win the tie.
- Choose randomly. If there are multiple characters tied for the same initiative value, have them roll a die and sort them from highest roll to lowest.


### Combat Escalation

See [Escalation Die] in the [Introduction] chapter. To summarize: each combat round starting with the third, add 1 to the Escalation Die. All characters gain a bonus to Hit Rolls equal to the Escalation Die.

### Rolling Initiative mid-combat

If new combatants enter an encounter, the GM can use one of the following options:

- Start Over: Add the new characters to the combat map. All characters use Total Defense as a Free Reaction (unless they are Surprised), then Roll Initiative again. Set the Escalation Die to 0.
- Keep Initiative: Add the new characters to the combat map. The new characters use Total Defense as a Free Reaction (unless they are Surprised), then Roll Initiative. Update the list of initiative values and resolve initiative value ties as usual. Reduce the Escalation die by 1, to a minimum of 0.

Regardless of the method used, any active powers, cooldowns or status effects remain unaffected.

The GM can choose a solution for rolling initiative mid-combat as they see fit. We recommend using the Start Over option only when many new characters enter combat - the equivalent of 2 Standard monsters or more.

## Actions

Types of action:

- **Move** : Action taken during a character's turn, usually to change position. A character can take 1 Move Action/turn
- **Standard** : Action taken during a character's turn, usually to make an attack. A character can take 1 Standard Action/turn
- **Minor** : Action taken during a character's turn, usually for something quick like picking up an object. A character can take 1 Minor Action/turn.
- **Free** : Action taken during a character's turn. Can be in response to a trigger.
- **Reaction** : Action taken outside a character's turn, in response to a trigger. A character can take 1 Reaction/Round.
- **Free Reaction** : Action taken outside a character's turn, in response to a trigger. Counts as both a Free Action and a Reaction. Does not count toward the limit of 1 Reaction/Round.

Reaction Keywords: The following keywords can apply to Reactions, Free Reactions, and to Free Actions with a trigger, to grant them special properties:

- **Interrupt** : Reaction resolves before the triggering event completes.
- **Automatic** : Can always be taken, even if the character is Unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions at that time.

Resolving Interrupts:

- An Interrupt action triggering in the middle of another character's action can stop the triggering action. For example, a character Immobilized by an Interrupt while moving stops their movement immediately.
- An Interrupt action can include Forced Movement. A character whose position changed because of an interrupt may find that some targets for the triggering action are now at a different range, or outside of range altogether. In that case, apply any new range modifiers as appropriate, and remove any out of range characters as valid targets. No new targets can be picked - if the triggering action no longer has enough valid targets, it stops.
- If the interrupted action included movement, and the Interrupt caused Forced Movement, the interrupted character subtracts the distance of the Forced Movement from the remaining movement distance. Then, if they have any movement distance left, they use it to move to a new position. This new position does not need to match the movement as declared before the interrupt.

**Opportunity Attacks** : The most common type of Reaction is the Opportunity Attack, a combat maneuver that all characters can make to attack adjacent enemies moving or making ranged attacks:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
library(sfrpg)
read_df_power() %>% dplyr::filter(type=='maneuver', Name=='Opportunity Attack') %>%
      dplyr::select(-type) %>% clean_df_power()  %>% .$htm_power %>% cat()

```



<div class="compatibility">Compatibility Note: Automatic actions were known as No Action in legacy rules.</div>

Limits to actions:

- During a character's turn:
  - One each of : Minor Action, Move Action, Standard Action.
  - One Free Action Attack.
  - Any number of non-attack Free Actions, but each power can only be used once per turn this way.
- Outside a character's turn:
  - One non-Free Reaction per round.
  - One Free Reaction attack per turn.
  - Any number of non-attack Free Reactions per turn, but each power can only be used once per turn this way.
- An Automatic action can always be taken, at any time, regardless of other action limits.

<div class="compatibility">*Compatibility Note:* Legacy rules have granted actions as Free Actions. They are now Free Reactions.

Example: "an ally can make a basic attack as a Free Action" becomes "an ally can make a basic attack as a Free Reaction.</div>

<div class="tip"> *Note:* Effects that prevent a character from taking Reactions also stop Free Reactions.</div>

<div class="tip"> *Note: *Unless otherwise stated, reactions cannot trigger further reactions. Notably, Taunted characters making Opportunity Attacks will not trigger Reactions from the taunting characters. </div>

Condition | Modifier
------------- | -------------
Defender grants Advantage to Attacker | +2
Defender has any Cover from Attacker | -2

Note: Characters with Superior Cover also benefit from regular Cover, so attacks
against them will have a total modifier of -5. Likewise, Characters with 
Superior Concealment also benefit from regular Concealment, and attacks against
them have a total modifier of -5.

## Status Effects

Some powers or abilities can apply status effects on characters. A character afflicted by a status effect suffers penalties that depend on the type condition - see the table below for details.

Normally, the effect creating a status effect states its duration, which is often a combat turn, but can also last until the character saves against the effect, or even indefinitely, depending on the case. Certain status effects have special rules affecting their duration, typically in the form of conditions that end the effect prematurely.

It is possible for a character to be affected by multiple instances of a status effect. The penalties from instances of the same condition don't stack unless otherwise stated.

Some status effects care about the source of the effect. For example, in the case of the Taunt status effect, the Taunted character does not suffer penalties when attacking the Taunting character. If multiple instances of such an effect are affecting a character, it is important to keep track of the source of each one.

### Downgrading status effects

Some abilities allow a character to downgrade a status effect. To downgrade a status effect, check the Downgrade column in the status effect table: the character treats the status effect as if it was the downgraded one for the duration of the downgrade. Note that a downgrade may have a shorter duration than the status effect it applies to - in that case, the original effect applies again when the Downgrade ends.

If the downgrade for a status effect is listed as No Effect, the effect is completely ignored while Downgraded. Likewise, if it is listed as No Downgrade, the effect cannot be downgraded.

A status effect can only be downgraded once at any given time. Notably, this means that abilities that downgrade multiple types of status effect do not stack with themselves. As an example, consider a character with the ability to downgrade the Slowed and Immobilized status effects. If that character becomes Immobilized, the downgrade would allow them to act as if they were Slowed instead - but it wouldn't let them ignore the Slow.

<div class="tip">
Tip - Hindered: Many types of action can cause a character to be Hindered for a turn. These include combat maneuvers like Shift, Charge, Stand Up, Quick Draw,
</div>

<div class="tip">
Sidebar: ignoring Taunts

An attack by a Taunted character ignores a Taunt if it targets an enemy not taunting the character. The following exceptions apply:

- If the attack targets multiple characters, and all enemies taunting the character are already targeted, any additional targets do not ignore the Taunt.
- If multiple attacks are made in sequence as part of the same attack power _(e.g. primary and secondary attacks)_, once all enemies Taunting the character have been targeted at least once, any additional targets do not ignore the Taunt.
- If an attack originally does not ignore the Taunt, and the attack targets are somehow changed by an enemy action or other effect, this does not cause the attack to ignore the Taunt.
- If an attack originally does not ignore the Taunt, and the attacker becomes Taunted during the attack _(e.g. by an enemy reaction)_, this does not cause the attack to ignore the mark.
</div>

<div class="compatibility">**Compatibility Note**: Defender Aura

Some characters in compatible books have the Defender Aura power. The effect of this power should be replaced with the following:

“Enemies in the aura are Taunted by you.”
</div>

<div class="compatibility">**Compatibility Note**: ignoring Taunts

Any reference from compatible books to effects that trigger when a Taunted character 'makes an attack that does not include the Taunting character as a target' should use the rules for ignoring Taunts described above.
</div>

### Stealth status effects

These effects are used by characters trying to hide in combat. Unlike other status effects, these are mostly beneficial and often entered voluntarily.

Status | Effects | Ends
| -- | -------- | -----
| Shrouded | Cannot be targeted by Ranged attacks, or Reaction attacks <br />-Cannot be Charged <br />-Cannot make Reaction attacks |Condition is lost: <br />-After attacking <br />-After moving <br />- If, at the end of a character’s action, the Shrouded character doesn’t have Cover (other than Body Cover) or Concealment against all enemies.
| Hidden | Cannot make Reaction attacks <br />-Gains Advantage when attacking <br />-Cannot be targeted by Melee or Ranged powers <br />-Cannot be targeted by a Close or Area power unless it targets a non-Hidden character. <br />-Location unknown to other characters <br /> | Condition is lost: <br />- After attacking <br />- After moving <br />- If, at the end of a character’s action, the Hidden character doesn’t have Cover (other than Body Cover) or Concealment against all enemies.


<div class="tip">
Tip: Although a Hidden character´s current location is unknown, other characters can guess it based on context: where the Hidden character was last seen, what suitable hiding locations are in the area, etc.
</div>

<div class="tip">
Clarification: Actions that grant the Shrouded or Hidden condition do not cause the loss of that condition if they include attacks or movement.
</div>

### Special Status Effects

These effectsare rarely used, typically by monsters.

Status | Downgrade | Effects
| --- | --- | ------
| Swallowed | Grabbed | -When swallowed, a character disappears from its current position. When the condition ends, the character reappears in a square of his choice as close as possible to the swallower. <br />- Can spend a move action to make an Escape Check (see sidebar). If successful, condition ends. <br />- Does not occupy a space. <br />- Can only take one action per turn. <br />- Only has line of effect and line of sight to and from the swallower, and other characters and objects swallowed by it. <br />- The inside of the swallower, and swallowed characters and objects, are in total darkness unless otherwise specified. Swallowed characters can use any light source to illuminate the inside of the swallower and all characters and objects swallowed by it. <br />- When using a burst or blast power while swallowed, the swallower and all characters and objects swallowed by it are included in the burst or blast.
| Exiled | Grabbed | - When exiled, a character disappears from its current position. <br />- When the condition ends, the character reappears on this position or, if not possible, in the closest ground square of his choice, unless the exiling effect states otherwise. <br />- Does not occupy a space. <br />- No line of sight to and from other creatures or objects unless the exiling effect states otherwise. <br />- No line of effect to and from other creatures or objects unless the exiling effect states otherwise.

### Legacy status effects

In legacy rules, status effects are referred to as conditions.

Some status effects have been renamed from legacy rules:

- Deafened: Renamed to Dazzled


### Forced Attacks

Certain powers or effects allow one character to force an enemy to make an attack. Such attacks are considered forced attacks, and use the following rules:

- If there are different attack powers that meet the requirement for the forced attack (e.g. basic attacks or at-will attacks), the character forcing the attack is aware of all available options and can choose any of them.
- For the chosen attack power, the character forcing the attack can make any relevant decision, including (but not limited to) targets, area of effect, forced movement caused by the attack.
- A character forced to make an attack cannot target himself with the forced attack.
- Forced attacks ignore the Taunted status effect . A character making a forced attack counts as not Taunted, for the purposes of that attack.
- Forced attacks never trigger opportunity attacks.


## Forced Movement {.newPage}

Certain powers or effects allow one character to force an enemy to make a move. Such movements are considered forced movement, and use the following rules:
- Forced Movement can be caused by Push, Pull and Slide effects. In these cases, the amount of squares of forced movement is indicated in the effect causing the forced movement.
- If a Push, Pull or Slide effect ends before the full distance is moved because the moved character collides with an obstacle or another character, each character involved in the collision takes Forced Movement Damage. This damage scales with the tier of the source of the forced movement as follows: 1d4 for Heroic sources,  2d4 for Paragon effects for Paragon sources, and 4d4 for Epic sources.
- Forced Movement can also be caused by effects that force the character to take an action to move in a particular direction. In this case, the amount of squares of forced movement depends on the character's speed unless otherwise stated, and is affected by any status effects or other conditions that restrict movement.
- Forced movement never triggers opportunity attacks or other character powers that would trigger on movement. Traps and hazardous terrain trigger normally.

### Saving against Forced Movement

Characters can use Forced Movement to get their opponents into a damaging area, or to crash them into a wall. This is considered fair game, and no saves are normally allowed. However, there is an exception to this: whenever forced movement would move a character off a cliff (or equivalent) and cause them to fall, that character is allowed to make a save to avoid the effect. The character takes a penalty to the save equal to the remaining squares of Forced Movement. On a successful save, the Forced Movement stops before the character is moved off the cliff, and the character is knocked prone.

At the GM's discretion, PCs (but not monsters) can also benefit from this rule whenever Forced Movement would put them in a particularly deadly position, such as a pool of lava.

<div class="tip">
Example 1: A goblin is adjacent to a precipice. A PC uses an attack with Push 1 to try to make the goblin fall: the goblin can attempt a save without penalties to avoid this effect and become Prone instead.

Example 2: A goblin is 1 square away from a precipice.  A PC uses an attack with Push 4 to try to make the goblin fall: the goblin can attempt a save to avoid this effect and become Prone instead. Since there are 4 squares of forced movement and 2 are spent to move the character over the precipice, the excess distance is 2 squares, and the goblin takes a -2 penalty to the save.
