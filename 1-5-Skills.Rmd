Using Skills

Some actions are only available to characters with an appropriate level of
 training in a skill. These are the levels of training that a character can 
 have in a skill:

- Untrained. This the level that most characters have with a skill. 
  Untrained characters have not received any formal training with a skill, 
  but they can still attempt basic tasks associated with it, and succeed with
  a bit of luck and natural talent.
- Trained. Characters Trained with a skill have spent significant time 
  practicing it, and can be considered experts in the area. Trained characters 
  rarely make errors on mundane tasks related to their skill of choice,
  and with effort and luck, they can even succeed on advanced actions out of
  the reach of amateurs.
- Master. Skill Masters are individuals of extraordinary talent who have
  become famous for their prowess with a particular skill.
- Grandmaster. Very few mortals ever reach this level of proficiency. The
  feats that Grandmasters can achieve are the stuff of legends.


For each skill, the associated Skill Bonus is generated
as follows: 

```
Skill Bonus = Ability Skill Bonus + Skill Training Bonus + Armor Penalty + Other Modifiers
```

 Building chapter

## Skill Actions

The following actions are available to PCs on Skill Encounters:

- Simple Skill Check
  - Standard Action
  - Check: Choose a relevant Skill, and make a check using the Base DC for the 
    challenge.
  - Success: Gain +1 Progress for this challenge
  - Option: With the GM's approval, the PC may increase DC by 1 to gain an 
    additional +1 Progress on a successful check.
- Partial Skill Check
  - Standard Action
  - Check: Choose a relevant Skill, and make a check using the Base DC for the 
    challenge minus 1.
  - Success: For each 3 successes in a Partial Skill Check, gain +1 Progress 
    for this challenge.
  - Special: This can be attempted multiple times per encounter, and the same 
    Skill may be reused, but each attempt needs to focus on a different part
    of the problem
- Skill Assist
  - Standard Action
  - Check: Choose a Skill Check that a character will make this encounter, and 
    a relevant Skill different that the one that will be used for that check. 
    Make a check using the Base DC for the challenge minus 1.
  - Success: The next character to make the chosen Skill Check gains Advantage 
    (+2 to the Skill Check).
- Skill Recovery
  - Standard Action
  - Check: After an ally has failed a Skill Check, choose a relevant Skill not 
    used on that check, and make a check using the Base DC for the challenge 
    minus 1.
  - Success: Choose one of the following:
    - Choose one of the characters that made the failed check. If that character
      lost Morale in that check, they recover 1 Morale.
    - Ignore the failed check for the purposes of determining check penalties 
      the next time a character attempts that check this encounter.
- Gain time
  - Standard Action
  - Check:  Choose a relevant Skill, and make a check using the Base DC for the 
    challenge minus 1.
  - Success: Prevent any increases of the Escalation Die next turn.
  - Special: This can be attempted multiple times per encounter, but a different
    Skill must be used each time
- Gather Information
  - Standard Action
  - Check: Choose a relevant Skill, and make a check using the Base DC for the
    challenge minus 2.
  - Success: Gain clues for challenge, or find out about new options to solve
    problem.
  - Option: This may be taken as a Minor Action by increasing its DC by 1.


There is also a special action that can only be used if all participating PCs
agree:
- Fail Forward
  - The Skill Challenge ends. Each participating PC spends 1 Stamina to have a
    Short Rest
  - At the GM's discretion, the challenge is overcome or a new path presents 
    itself so that the characters can progress. The characters suffer a minor
    loss in the context of the story.
  - Minor loss examples: Wasted time, lost equipment, displeased NPCs, 
    embarrassment, inconveniences.
    
Players are encouraged to use Fail Forward once other options have been 
exhausted, or once all characters become Demoralized.

## Skill Challenges

Level | Challenge Tier | Required progress | DC
- | -- | - | --
1 | Basic | 3 | Normal
3 | Basic, Long | 5 | Normal
6 | Heroic | 3 | Hard
11 | Heroic, Long | 5 | Hard
16 | Paragon | 3 | Very Hard
21 | Paragon, Long | 5 | Very Hard
26 | Epic | 3 | Legendary
31 | Epic, Long | 5 | Legendary
36 | Impossible | 3 | Impossible


Adjustments by party size:

- Assumption: Default party size is 4 to 6
- 1 PC: Required Progress of 3 becomes 1, and 5 becomes 2.
- 2-3 PCs: -1 Required Progress
- 7-8 PCs: +1 Required Progress

Partial success: If the players achieve more than half the required Progress
for the encounter, they should achieve partial success (determined by the GM).
Likewise, any negative consequences due to Fail Forward should be mitigated 
if partial success is reached.


## Roleplaying die roll

With the GM's consent, players participating in a Skill Check that involves
interaction with other characters, or where planning is important may replace
the usual method of resolving Skill Checks with a Roleplaying Die Roll.

In a Roleplaying Die Roll, instead of rolling a D20, have the players describe
in detail the actions the carry out to solve the problem. The GM then judges 
their performance based on the quality of the solution, and modifies the result
based on roleplaying considerations.

```
Roleplaying Die Roll = Solution Score + Roleplaying Modifier
```

Solution Score: Use the following values instead of the check d20, based on the GM's judgement:

- Terrible: The described solution fails to address the challenge: Automatic failure
- Below Average: The described solution only addresses the challenge partially, or under specific conditions: 6+1d4
- Good: The described solution fully addresses the challenge: 11+1d4
- Excellent: The described solution fully addresses the challenge, in a particularly imaginative or effective way: 16+1d4

Roleplaying Modifier: Apply the following modifiers based on the GM's judgement of the role playing:

- The described solution is out of place for the character, given their background and personality: Automatic failure
- The described solution slightly conflicts with the character’s background or personality: -2
- The described solution matches the character’s background and personality: +0
- The described solution provides new and relevant insight about the character’s background and personality: +2

Once the Roleplaying Die Roll is resolved, add the Skill Bonus and compare with
the target difficulty as usual:

```
Skill Check (with Roleplaying Die) = Roleplaying Die Roll + Skill Bonus 
```
