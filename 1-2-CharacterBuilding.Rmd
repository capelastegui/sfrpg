This chapter provides the rules for creating and levelling Player Characters.
 The overall character creation process is first described, and then each
 creation and levelling step is discussed in detail: stat generation, Origin
 and class selection, mundane equipment, feat selection, levelling up, and
 using magic items.

## Character Creation Overview

From the initial character concept to the point where the character sheet is
 complete, there are several decisions that a player must take in order to
 create a first level character. In this section, we explain the character
 creation process as a whole, and a more detailed discussion of each step is
 provided later on.

The basic steps for creating a character are:

1. Character concept and story
1. Origin and Class selection
1. Ability generation
1. Skill selection
1. Equipment selection
1. Feat selection
1. Power selection
1. (Levelling)

<div class="tip">**Tip**: Although beginning players are encouraged to follow
 the character creation steps in order as listed above, it is quite possible to
 go back and forth between steps, as each decision provides new inspiration and
 ideas to improve on previous choices. Furthermore, since the number of
 available options may get overwhelming for inexperienced (and not so
 inexperienced) players, we provide pre-built sample characters that can be
 played as-is, or used as basic templates to be customized to taste. These
 sample characters, along with suggested level-up options up to level 30, can
 be found in the Classes chapter.</div>

## Ability generation

Once the player has decided on a character class and a class build, the 
 Abilities for the Player Character can be generated. To do this, the player
 selects a Primary and a Secondary ability, and then assigns scores to each.
 These choices are usually conditioned, if not fully determined, 
 by the character's class build:

- The **Primary Ability** is the character's strongest and most important
  Ability, used for most attacks. Most class builds have a fixed Primary
  Ability.
- The **Secondary Ability** adds useful bonuses to several character Powers
  and Class Features. Many class builds have a predetermined Secondary Ability,
  though some provide a choice between two or three options.

Assign the following scores:

- +4 to Primary Ability
- +3 to Secondary Ability
- +0 to to other Abilities

<div class="compatibility">**Compatibility Note**: Under legacy rules, 
 PCs used to get Ability increases from their Origin (then called Race), 
 as well as from levelling up. This is no longer the case, but see the
 Ability Skill Bonus section below.</div>

<div class="compatibility">**Compatibility Note**: The only remaining way to 
 increase Ability Scores is through Epic Destinies. However, whenever
 an Epic Destiny from a legacy rulebook provides a bonus to an Ability score,
 that bonus is halved (typically from +2 to +1).</div>

### Wide Ability Array (Advanced rule)

The set of Ability scores described above is known as the 
 **Default Ability Array**, and should be a good fit for the majority of 
 characters. However, some character builds may have ability requirements that 
 are spread across many abilities, usually due to heavy multiclassing or to 
 being non-conventional designs from early legacy sourcebooks. For those cases, 
 and with approval of the GM, a player may choose instead the 
 **Wide Ability Array** - choose one Primary Ability and **two** Secondary
 Abilities (instead of just one, as usual), and assign the following scores:
 
- +3 to Primary Ability
- +3 to Secondary Ability
- +0 to to other Abilities

<div class="tip">**Tip**: We recommend new players to ignore the 
 **Wide Ability Array**. Even experienced players should stay away from this
 most of the time - it's just offered as a patch from some old classes that
 would otherwise be very difficult to play. </div>

### Tertiary Ability and Weak Ability (Optional)

As an option, players can choose two Abilities that are not Primary nor 
Secondary to be their Tertiary and Weak Abilities:

- The **Tertiary Ability** is an Ability with a slightly above average score.
- The **Weak Ability** is an Ability that sees little to no use for the
  character, and has the lowest score. Class builds should provide suggestions
  for suitable Weak Abilities, but the choice is otherwise up to the player.
  
Assign the following scores:

- +1 to Tertiary Ability
- -1 to Weak Ability

<div class="tip">**Tip**: Having a Tertiary and Weak abilities very slightly
 increases a PC's effectiveness, but it's not really a required step in 
 character generation. New players are encouraged to skip this step until they 
 have a good grasp of the rules of the game and the impact of changing these 
 ability scores. We recommend GMs to allow selection of Tertiary and Weak
 abilities at a later point in the game, such as after reaching Level 2.
</div>

## Skill Bonuses  

There are 12 Skills in the game that determine how good a character is at 
different activities. For each skill, the associated Skill Bonus is generated
as follows: 

```
Skill Bonus = Ability Skill Bonus + Skill Training Bonus + Armor Penalty + Other Modifiers
```

Each of these modifiers is explained in a separate section below.

The following table shows all 12 Skills with their corresponding Abilities and
a summary of what they are used for. For a detailed description of Skills and
 how they work, see the [Skills] chapter.
 
 Skill | Ability | Summary
-- | -- | --- 
Athletics | Strength | Sprinting, Climbing, Swimming
Authority | Strength | Intimidation, Leadership, Military
Concentration | Constitution | Study, Craftsmanship, Art
Endurance | Constitution | Resilience, Wakefulness, Survival
Finesse | Dexterity | Balance, Tumbling, Lockpicking
Stealth | Dexterity | Hiding, Secrets, Ciphers
Perception | Wisdom | Observation, Empathy, Memory
Nature | Wisdom | Flora, Fauna, Environment, Healing
Diplomacy | Charisma | Rethoric, Etiquette, Politics
Trickery | Charisma | Lying, Gossip, Forgery
Arcana | Intelligence | Magic, Science, Cosmology
Lore | Intelligence | History, Geography, Law

### Ability Skill Bonus

Each Skill has an associated Ability, which is used to determine the 
 Skill Bonus. However, rather than directly adding ability scores to the
 Skill Bonus, we use a related value, called the Ability Skill Bonus. Unlike 
 Ability scores, which remain constant after a character creation, an 
 Ability Skill Bonus can be affected by the character's Origin, and increase 
 as they level up.
 
For each Ability, the corresponding Ability Skill Bonus is generated as follows:

```
Ability Skill Bonus = Ability + Origin Ability Modifier + Ability Skill Points + Other Modifiers
```

An explanation for each :
- **Ability**: Ability Score
- **Origin Ability Modifier**: Modifier to that Ability Skill Bonus from the
  character's Origin. Typically, Origins add +1 to 2 fixed Ability Skill Bonuses
- **Ability Skill Points**: Players get to assign extra points to add to their 
  Ability Skill Bonus as they level up - see the table below.
- **Other Modifiers**: Characters can gain additional modifiers from Feats or
 Magic Items, among other sources.
  
Ability Skill Points are gained at levels 4, 8, 14, 18, 24 and 28. When a 
PC reaches one of these levels, they choose an Ability and add 1 to the
Ability Skill Points  assigned to that Ability Skill Bonus, as shown
in the table below:

Level | Points gained | Score Limit
4 | +1 | +2
8 | +1 | +3
14 | +1 | +3
18 | +1 | +4
24 | +1 | +4
28 | +1 | +5
  
Players are restricted in the abilities they can choose to increase their
 Ability Skill Points: only abilities where the sum of Ability Score and 
 current Ability Skill Points are below a certain value (shown in column Score
 Limit of the table above) can be chosen this way. Other bonuses, such as
 the Origin Ability Modifier, are not counted towards the Score Limit.

 
<div class="tip">
 Example - Ability Skill Bonus for a Level 1 PC.
 Gimli is a Level 1 Dwarf Warrior with +4 Str, +3 Con, and +0 to other 
 abilities. Origin Ability Modifiers for a Dwarf are +1 Con, +1 Wis. This
 character will have the following Ability Skill Bonuses:
 
 - Str: +4 (Ability)
 - Con: +3 (Ability) +1 (Origin) ; Total: +4
 - Dex: +0 (Ability)
 - Wis: +0 (Ability) +1 (Origin) ; Total: +1 
 - Int: +0 (Ability) 
 - Cha: +0 (Ability)
</div>

<div class="tip">Example - Ability Skill Points.
 The character from the previous example levels up. When he reaches level 4, he
 can gain an Ability Skill Point on any ability other than Str and Con. 
 He chooses to add a point to Wis. Ability Skill Bonus for Wis at Level 4:
 
 - Wis: +0 (Ability) +1 (Origin) +1 (Points); Total: +2 
 
 At level 8, he can add an Ability Skill point on any ability other than Str.
 He chooses Con this time.  Ability Skill Bonus for Con at Level 8:
 
 - Con: +3 (Ability) +1 (Origin) +1 (Points); Total: +5 
 </div>


### Choosing Skill Training

Depending on their class, Player Characters can choose a number of Skills to
 become Trained in them. Characters gain a +3 bonus to Skill Checks with
 Trained Skills, and Skill Checks of Hard Difficulty are only available to
 characters with training in that Skill.

In order to select a Player Character's Skills, the player should look look at
 the Class Skill List for the character's class, as well as the Racial Skill
 List for the character's Origin. Any Skill in either of these lists can be
 selected as a Trained Skill for the character. The player then looks at the
 number of Trained Skills allowed by the character's class, and selects that
 many Trained Skills. 

<div class="compatibility">**Compatibility Note**: The Racial Skill rule
 replaces racial Skill bonuses from legacy rulebooks. When a Origin provides
 a numeric bonus to one or more Skills, consider instead that these Skills
 are Racial Skills. Any other Skill-related benefit, such as gaining Training
 with a specific Skill, remains unchanged. </div>

Some Origins and Classes provide automatic training with predetermined Skills.
 In that case, the character first gains training with these skills, and then
 the player selects Trained Skills as usual.


<div class="tip">**Tip**: When selecting Trained Skills, it is usually a
 good idea to prioritize Skills that match the character's Primary or Secondary
 Abilities. If you end up with training in two or more Skills associated with
 your Tertiary or Weak Abilities, consider taking Unnatural Ability as an Adventure
 Feat when you level up, in order to compensate for the lower Ability scores in
 these Skills.</div>

<div class="tip">**Tip**: As your character levels up, you can expand your
 Trained Skill selection by taking Skill Training as an Adventure Feat.
 Alternatively, you can specialize on your best Skills by taking Skill Focus
 as an Adventure Feat.</div>

### Apply Armor Penalty to Skill

Some types of armor have an Armor Penalty value
 (typically -1). This penalty applies to Skill Checks for Athletics, Endurance,
 Finesse, and Stealth. See [Armor] in the [equipment] section of this chapter
 for more information.

### Other Skill Bonuses

Characters can gain additional modifiers from Feats or Magic
  Items, among other sources.

## Equipment selection

A character's class determines which weapons, implements and armor the
 character is proficient with. Upon creation, every character starts the
 game with the following items:
 
- Up to three weapons the character is proficient with.
- An armor the character is proficient with.
- Up to one implement the character is proficient with.

In addition, starting characters get mundane equipment that has no impact on
 their stats and powers, including clothing, adventuring supplies, food, and
 money. The specific details should vary based on the character's background
 and the context of the initial adventure, and be the result of a dialogue
 between player and Game Master. We suggest, by default, providing characters
 with food for a week of travel, money to cover living for a month, and a
 non-exhaustive list of items to carry with them, such as bedrolls, rope, and
 torches. In addition, whenever a more unusual item of reasonable weight and
 cost is needed, we recommend the Game Master to assume that a character is
 carrying it, provided that the player can come up with a convincing explanation.

<div class="design">**Designer Note**: Some games aim to provide a detailed
 simulation of economy in a fantasy world. This is not such a game. We believe
 that keeping track of the specific contents of a player's backpack or the
 balance of each economic transaction are not critical to the game experience.
 Instead, we recommend players and Game Masters to keep inventories vague and
 flexible, outside of player rewards like Magic Items, or items of special
 importance to the game plot.

That said, if you favor more detailed rules for economy, there are tables
 with recommended item costs and weights from other game systems, such as
 D20SRD  (http://www.d20srd.org/indexes/equipment.htm ) and 13AGESRD 
 (http://www.13thagesrd.com/equipment ), which are freely available online.
 You can use these tables as a reference for setting item prices in your
 campaign.</div>

In the rest of this section, we list the weapons, armor and implement available
 in the game, along with a description of their rules.

### Weapons

Each weapon in the game is described by the following elements:

- **Name**
- **Family**: A category of weapons with similar properties. For example, Axes
  is a weapon family that includes hand axes, battle axes, and greataxes. 
- **Damage**: Base damage dealt per weapon damage die.
- **Keywords**: Special properties associated with the weapon.
- **Training**: How much training is required to wield the weapon, determines
  which classes can use it.
- **Type**: Whether it is a Melee or Ranged weapon.
- **Hands**:Whether the weapon requires 1 or 2 hands to be wielded.

A character's class determines which weapons the character is trained to use.
 A character using a weapon without training does not benefit from any of the
 weapon's properties, including damage, keywords, and any magic abilities.
 Instead, the weapon is treated as an Light Improvised Weapon if it requires
 one hand to wield, or a Heavy Improvised Weapon if it requires two hands.
 Improvised weapons can be used without training.

<div class="compatibility">**Compatibility Note**: In legacy rulebooks, weapon
 training is referred to as weapon proficiency, and weapons can have a
 Proficiency Bonus to hit, if the character is trained with them. This
 Proficiency Bonus no longer exists, and any mentions to it should be
 ignored. </div>

#### Weapon Families

The following weapon families are supported in the game:

- **Axe**: Melee weapon consisting of a heavy edged head and a handle.
- **Bow**: Ranged weapon consisting of a strip of wood or other flexible
  material and a string, used to shoot arrows.
- **Crossbow**: Ranged weapon consisting on a bow mounted on a stick and a
  mechanism to hold the string. Used to shoot bolts.
- **Flail**: Melee weapon consisting on a blunt or spiked head attached to a
  handle by a chain or rope.
- **Hammer**: Melee weapon consisting of a heavy blunt head and a handle.
- **Heavy Blade**: Melee weapon with a long and heavy blade 
- **Improvised**: A common object used as a weapon, or a weapon used without
  training. 
- **Light Blade**: Melee weapon with a short or slender blade
- **Sling**: Ranged weapon consisting of a pouch and a string, used to throw
  stones or bullets.
- **Spear**: Melee weapon consisting of a pointed head attached to a long shaft.
- **Staff**: Melee weapon consisting of a long wooden shaft.
- **Unarmed**: A character's own body used as a melee weapon.

<div class="tip">**Tip**: Weapon Family is of special relevance in relation to
 the Weapon Focus category of Feats, as these Feats often give bonuses when
 wielding any weapon of a specific family. Advanced players are encouraged to
 study the different Feat bonuses when considering their weapon of choice. For
 beginning players, we suggest instead to choose based on aesthetic preferences
 - you can always use the Retraining rule to rethink your choice at a later
 point.</div>

#### Weapon Keywords

The following weapon keywords are supported in the game:

- **Off-Hand**: The weapon can be wielded in the off-hand while another weapon
  or object is wielded in the main hand. 
- **Parry**: A character wielding one or more weapons or shields with Parry
  gains +1 to Arm against Melee and Close attacks. The bonus from multiple
  instances of this keyword does not stack.
- **Ranged**: Ranged weapons have the Range keyword, followed by a number
  indicating the Weapon Range. Characters can make Ranged and Area attacks
  up to a distance equal to the Weapon Range without penalty. In addition,
  characters can make Ranged (but not Area) attacks at long range, to distances
  between Weapon Range and twice the Weapon Range, with a -2 penalty to hit.
- **Reach**: Weapons with reach increase the Melee Reach for attacks made with
  them by a certain amount. A medium-sized character typically has a Melee
  Reach of 1, which increases to 2 with a Reach +1 weapon, and to 3 with a
  Reach +2 weapon.
- **Throw**: Melee weapons with Throw can be used to make Ranged and Area
  attacks as well as Melee and Close attacks. The Throw keyword is followed by
  a number indicating the Weapon Range. Characters can make Ranged and Area
  attacks up to a distance equal to the Weapon Range without penalty. In
  addition, characters can make Ranged (but not Area) attacks at long range,
  to distances between Weapon Range and twice the Weapon Range, with a
  -2 penalty to hit. After using a Ranged or Area attack power with a Throw
  weapon, choose a character targeted by the attack. The weapon is placed on
  the ground in a square in the character's space. Magical Weapons with Throw
  are automatically returned to the wielder's hand after each attack instead.
- **Unwieldy**: Attacks made with this weapon gain a -1 penalty to hit.
- **Versatile**: When wielded on the main hand with a free off-hand, this
  weapon deals +1 damage per weapon damage die. This increases to +2 damage
  per weapon damage die at level 16.
- **Very Unwieldy**: Attacks made with this weapon gain a -2 penalty to hit.

<div class="compatibility">**Compatibility Note** In legacy rulebooks, Throw
 weapons can be classified as Heavy Thrown or Light Thrown. Treat any mention
 to either of these as referring to Throw weapons instead.</div>

#### Weapon Hands

The hand requirements to use a weapon are as follows:

- **One-handed weapons without the Off-Hand keyword** can be wielded in the
  character's **main hand**. The character can wield another item, such as
  an Off-Hand weapon, an implement or a Shield, in the Off-Hand.
- **One-handed weapons with the Off-Hand keyword** can be wielded in the
  character's **main hand or off-hand**. The character can wield another item,
  such as an Off-Hand weapon, an implement or a Shield, in the other hand.
  When making an attack, a character can choose to use either the main hand
  weapon or the Off-Hand weapon - there are no penalties for Off-Hand attacks.
- **Two-handed weapons** require both hands to be wielded. A character cannot
  use a hand to wield any other item while wielding such a weapon.

**One-handed versatility** : A character wielding a One-Handed weapon while
 leaving the other hand free can choose to take a -1 Hit penalty on an attack
 with that weapon to gain a +1 bonus to the weapon damage (scaling with Weapon
 Damage Multiplier). When they do, that weapon counts as Two-Handed for the
 purpose of powers or abilities that care about weapon types.

<div class="tip">**Tip**: It is usually better to use two-handed weapons, or
 One-handed weapons with a free hand or a Light Shield, if you want your
 character to focus on the offense, and a one-handed weapon with a Heavy
 Shield if you prefer focusing on defense. Wielding a weapon in each hand
 offers you extra flexibility, but otherwise it does not grant additional
 attacks or any other inherent benefits, so it is usually not a good idea,
 unless you have class Powers or Features that require dual wielding or
 otherwise reward you for it.</div>

#### Weapon Tables

The tables below provide stats for all weapons in the game, classified by the
 type of training they require, whether they are melee or ranged weapons, and
 the number of hands they require.


##### Basic Weapons
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
extract_equip_table(df_equip, 'Weapons', 'Basic') %>% cat()
```

##### Improvised Weapons
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
extract_equip_table(df_equip, 'Weapons', 'Improvised') %>% cat()
```
##### Martial Weapons
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
extract_equip_table(df_equip, 'Weapons', 'Martial') %>% cat()
```
##### Inner Weapons
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
extract_equip_table(df_equip, 'Weapons', 'Inner') %>% cat()
```


Some character classes use unique weapons not available to other classes. In
 these cases, stats for these weapons should be provided within the class rules.

<div class="compatibility">**Compatibility Note**: Some weapon types from legacy
 rulebooks are no longer supported. As a general rule, we recommend treating
 any such weapon as a currently supported weapon of the same Family, Training,
 Type, and Hand requirements, if available. Some cases of particular interest
 are:
 
Two previously existing weapon families, Picks and Maces, 
 have been discontinued. We recommend replacing Picks with Axes of similar
 properties, and replacing Maces with Hammers of similar properties. 

Some weapons used to have the same name as their weapon family. To remove
 this ambiguity, they have been renamed:

- **Spear** is now Halfspear
- **Crossbow** is now Light Crossbow
- **Flail** is now Light Flail

Some character classes from legacy sourcebooks have bonuses associated with
 obsoleted weapon types. We recommend the following replacements for these
 weapons:

- **Sickle**: replace with Dagger
- **Scimitar**: replace with Short Sword
- **Club**: replace with Mace
</div>

### Armor

Each armor in the game is described by the following elements:

- **Name**
- **Arm bonus**: Bonus granted to a character's Arm for wearing the armor
  with training.
- **Type**: Whether the armor is Light Armor or Heavy Armor, or a Shield. 
- **Armor Penalty**: Penalty granted to Ranged and Area attacks and many Skills.
- **Movement Penalty**: Penalty granted to a character's Speed (for all
  available movement types).

Each character can wear one suit of Light Armor or Heavy Armor. In addition,
 each character can use one Shield. Characters wearing nothing but plainclothes,
 or wearing no clothes, are considered as wearing Cloth Armor. Using a shield
 takes up one hand, and characters cannot wield weapons or implements nor
 carry objects with their shield hand.

**Armor Penalty**: Some types of armor have an Armor Penalty value
 (typically -1). This penalty applies to Skill Checks for Athletics, Endurance, Finesse, and Stealth.

 **Range Penalty**: Some types of armor have a Range Penalty value (typically -2).
 This penalty reduces the range of Ranged and Area powers, and is applied before
  doubling the range for Long Range attacks.

 <div class="tip">**Example**: A character wearing a Chainmail (Range Penalty -2)
  that makes a Ranged attack with a base range of 5 will have the normal range
   reduced to 3, and the Long Range will be double the normal range, for a total
   of 6. That same character making an Area attack with a base range of 10 would have
    the range for that attack reduced to 8.</div>

<div class="tip">**Tip**: Characters focused on Ranged and Area attacks should
 consider carefully whether the added protection of Heavy Armor is worth taking
 the Range Penalty</div>

A character's class determines which armors the character is trained to use.
 A character using an armor without training does not benefit from any of the
 armor's properties, including Arm bonus and any magic abilities. However, any
 Armor Penalty or Movement Penalty imposed by the armor still applies. All
 characters are considered to be trained in the use of Cloth Armor.

A character using a Shield and wearing Light Armor or Heavy Armor can add the
 Arm bonuses from shield and armor.

Some character classes gain an additional bonus to Arm while wearing Light Armor.
 This is called Light Armor Arm Bonus. Some classes also have class features
 that grant a bonus to Arm, and these can stack with their Light Armor Arm Bonus.
 A table summarizing Light Armor Arm Bonus and other stats for all classes
 currently in the game (including classes from legacy rulebooks) is provided in
 this chapter, in the Origin and Class Selection section. 

To summarize, a character's Arm is calculated as follows:
```
Arm= 10 + Armor bonus + Shield bonus + Class Light Armor bonus
```

Note that these are the most common types of Arm bonus, but other bonuses
 granted by specific Class Features, Feats, or Powers can still apply.

<div class="compatibility">**Compatibility Note**: Unlike other defenses, a
 character's Abilities provide no bonus to that character's Arm. In legacy
 rulebooks this was not the case, and it was common to have character classes
 whose Class Features allowed using an Ability as a bonus to Arm while wearing
 Light Armor. Ignore these bonuses, and any other mention of an Ability bonus
 to Arm. Fixed bonuses to Arm that do not depend on a character's Abilities still
 apply as normal.
 </div>

#### Armor Types

The different types of armor available in the game are described as follows:

- Light Armor
    * **Cloth**: Regular clothing, or Robes
    * **Leather**: A combination of regular clothing and leather pieces for
      added protection, such as a leather jacket or coat, a leather suit, or
      leather breastplates.

- Heavy Armor
    * **Hide**: A combination of regular clothing, leather pieces, and thick
      pieces of beast skin for added protection.
    * **Chain**: Armor made of interlocking metal rings.
    * **Scale**: Armor made of small, overlapping metal scales.
    * **Plate**: Armor made of large metal plates.

- Shield
    * **Light Shield**: Shield of reduced size and weight.
    * **Heavy Shield**: Large shield that covers most of a character's body.
    
#### Armor Table

The table below provides stats for all types of armor in the game:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
extract_equip_table(df_equip, 'Armor') %>% cat
```

Shields have the following rules:

- **Light Shield**: Gain Parry (+1 Arm vs Melee and Close attacks)
- **Heavy Shield**: -1 Hit on all attacks. Gain +2 Arm.

### Implements

Each implement in the game is described by the following elements:

- **Name**
- **Hands**: Whether the implement requires a hand, two hands, or no hands at
  all to wield.
- **Keywords**: Special properties associated with the implement.
- **Range**: base range for Implement Ranged Basic Attacks made with the
  implement.

Note that, unlike weapons, implements do not have an associated damage die.
 Damage in implement attacks is not affected by the choice of implement. The
 only mechanical differences between implements are their hand requirements,
 the bonuses provided by their associated Implement Focus Feats, and the range
 for Implement Ranged Basic Attacks (but not for other ranged attacks). The
 rules for Implement Ranged Basic Attacks are in the Stat Generation section
 of this chapter.

A character's class determines which implements the character is trained to
 use. A character wielding no implement, or wielding an implement without
 training uses the "No Implement" stats, which include a -2 penalty to hit
 due to the Very Unwieldy property. A character using an implement without
 training does not benefit from any of the implement's properties, including
 damage, keywords, and any magic abilities. 

#### Implement Types

The following implement types are supported in the game:

- **Staff** - Long shaft, usually made of wood.
- **Wand** - Short, slender stick.
- **Rod** - Long, decorated stick.
- **Orb** - Sphere made of a transparent or reflective material
- **Tome** - Heavy leather-bound book with inscribed spells
- **Symbol** - Amulet or necklace bearing the symbol of a deity
- **Focus** - Small carried object used to channel inner energy
- **Totem** - Carved figure representing an animal, plant, or spirit.
- **Weapon Implement** - Weapon that can be used to channel supernatural powers.
  Some character classes allow specific types of weapons to be used as Weapon
  Implements. Weapon Implements require the same number of hands to wield as
  their associated weapons.
- **No Implement** - A character using just hand gestures to channel power.

#### Implement Keyword

The following implement keywords are supported in the game:

- **Very Unwieldy**: Attacks made with this implement gain a -2 penalty to hit.

#### Implement Hands

The hand requirements to use a weapon are as follows:

- **No Hand implements** do not require any free hands to be wielded.
- **One-handed implements** can be wielded in the character's **main hand** or
  **off-hand**.
- **Two-handed implements** require both hands to be wielded. A character
  cannot use a hand to wield any other item while wielding such an implement.

#### Implement Table

The table below provide stats for all implements in the game:

A Feat is a character customization option that lets player specialize their
 characters beyond their Origin, Class, and Power selection.

There are two main categories of feats:

- **Combat Feats**: Feats that improve a character's combat abilities.
- **Adventure Feats**: Feats that improve a character's abilities out of combat.

Player Characters start the game with one Combat Feat and no Adventure Feats, and acquire
more as they level up, up to a maximum of nine of each at level 30. Bonus feats can also be
gained from other sources, such as a character's Origin or Class.

Each Feat is composed of the following elements:

- **Name**
- **Type**: Combat or Adventure.
- **Level**: The minimum level at which the Feat can be acquired. Also, the
  minimum level of the Feat Slot that can be used to learn the Feat.
- **Category**: A group of Feats that perform a similar function. A character
  can only select a single Feat from each Feat Category, unless the feats are
  Unrestricted.
- **Keywords**: A series of labels that describe the Feat. Feat Keywords are
  purely descriptive and have no associated rules, but are sometimes referenced
  by other Feats.
- **Requirements**: A series of conditions that a character must meet before
  taking the Feat.
- **Description**: The benefits granted by the feat.
- **Summary**: An abbreviated version of the Feat Description, used in summary
  tables. The Summary text does not necessarily provide exact or complete
  rules, and should only be used as a quick guide for character building
  decisions, not as a rules reference.


Feats can have the following special properties:

- **Unrestricted**: A character can take multiple Unrestricted feats within the same category.
- **Repeatable**: A Feat with this property can be taken multiple times. (This also ignores the

Each Combat Feat slot can be used to gain a Feat with a level equal or lower to that
 of the Feat Slot. Likewise, each Adventure Feat slot can be used to gain an Adventure
 Feat with a level equal or lower to that of the Adventure Feat Slot. Note that
 Combat Feats and Adventure Feats are not interchangeable: a Combat Feat Slot cannot be used to
 gain Adventure Feats, nor can an Adventure Feat slot be used to gain Combat Feats.

<div class="tip">**Tip**: Although the power level of Feats tends to grow with
 their level, the differences are sometimes very small. Often, a lower level
 Feat will be just as effective for a given character as the higher level
 alternatives, if not the best option altogether.</div>

<div class="tip">**Tip**: At some levels, a Feat Slot can only be filled with
 lower level Feats.</div>

<div class="tip">**Tip**: If you are lost, or want to experiment, choosing
 legal Feats at random is still expected to yield competent (if unfocused)
 characters.</div>

<div class="compatibility">**Compatibility Note**: Feats from legacy rulebooks
 are considered obsolete and should not be used. This is not, strictly speaking,
 due to compatibility issues (since the Feats should mostly work under the
 current rules), but as a way to improve the game experience - see the
 Designer's Note below for a detailed explanation. That said, Game Masters who
 wish to incorporate legacy Feats into their campaigns can do so with minimal
 translation effort, as long as they are aware that they risk breaking design
 assumptions about combat length and difficulty, and class balance.
 </div>


<div class="design">**Designer Note**: Experienced players may find this
 Feat system too restrictive compared to those of previous games. However,
 these restrictions serve an important purpose. Here is the reasoning behind
 them:

- **Separation between combat options and adventuring options**: Allowing
  characters to freely choose between combat and non-combat Feats results in
  excessive performance variability, to the point that it's virtually
  impossible to design high level content that will be moderately difficult
  and enjoyable to both characters that are completely specialized on combat
  and characters that only select non-combat Feats. Furthermore, it is usually
  optimal to ignore either combat or non-combat options (depending on the
  campaign), resulting in roughly half the Feats in the game seeing little
  to no play. The split between Combat and Adventure Feats allows us to
  get much more predictable character
  outcomes, which make for a better high level game experience. This also
  allows players to improve both their combat and non-combat capabilities
  without feeling that they are hurting their character's potential.
- **Feat categories**: It is a natural thing for players to experiment with
  spending all of their customization resources in improving a single dimension
  of their character, such as damage, or defenses, or even mobility. Again,
  this leads to excessive variability between high level character builds
  and, as a consequence, high variability in game difficulty, combat length,
  and overall game experience. By classifying Feats into functional Categories,
  and restricting players to one Feat per Category, we can, for example,
  provide dozens of options to increase attack damage while ensuring that a
  given character will only be able to have two or three of them at once.
- **No support for previous Feats**: We wanted every Feat in the game to have
  a purpose, and to be playable for a significant percentage of character
  builds. However, legacy rulebooks had thousands of Feats with wildly
  inconsistent quality and power level. We decided that starting from
  scratch and having a compact set of Feats that could realistically be
  tested and polished was the best option.
- **No class/Origin requirements**: We wanted the total number of feats to
  be manageable for players, but also to maintain backwards compatibility
  with previous Origins and Classes. Since legacy rulebooks have dozens of
  Origins and Classes, and including Feats for only a subset of them would
  be considered unfair and introduce balance issues, we chose to remove
  racial feats altogether and replace Class Feats with options based on
  Class Role and Power Source, which fill a similar niche with much less effort
  and complexity. That said, we might reconsider this for future supplements.

## Power selection

The following table summarizes the acquisition of power slots per character level, for classes with standard levelling progression. Note that there are classes with non-standard progressions - the powers gained per level for these classes are listed as part of the class description.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
library(sfrpg)
df_power_progression <- read_my_csv('progression_powers')
df_power_progression %>% build_table_apply() %>% cat()

```

<div class="compatibility">**Compatibility Note**: This is mostly the same progression used in legacy rules, except
that utility power slots at levels 16, 26 used to be additional slots and are now upgrade slots. Characters have the
option of taking feats (Paragon Utility, Epic Utility) to gain back these power slots.</div>
