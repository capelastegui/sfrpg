Most stats work the same way as for PCs or monsters - use defense stats and HP when the companion is attacked, and movement when the companion takes a move action. The following stats are unique to beast companions: H: Beast hit bonus. Base bonus applied to hit rolls made by the companion. B: Beast damage die. Damage die used in attack rolls made by the companion. An attack may roll multiple of these dice, and can apply additional bonus, e.g. 2B + Wis. Whenever a companion trait of Beast attack asks you to use an ability modifier, use the rangers abilities. Beast HP depend on the rangers level, and are determined using the following table: Level Medium HP High HP 1 16 22 2 18 24 3 19 26 4 21 28 5 22 30 6 24 32 7 25 34 8 27 36 9 28 38 10 30 40 11 33 44 12 36 48 13 39 52 14 42 56 15 45 60 16 48 64 17 51 68 18 54 72 19 57 76 20 60 80 21 66 88 22 72 96 23 78 104 24 84 112 25 90 120 26 96 128 27 102 136 28 108 144 29 114 152 30 120 160 The ranger controls their companions actions. Companions act in the same initiative turn as the ranger, and dont have their own pool of actions. Instead, they can act when the ranger spends an action, in the following ways: When the ranger takes a Move Action, the companion can move its speed for free. When the ranger uses Total Defense, the companion can do the same for free. When the ranger uses an attack power with the Beast keyword, the companion can make attacks as part of that action. The ranger gains the class feature power Beast Strike, which allows them to spend a Free Action to make the companion attack an enemy. The companion has a melee basic attack, shown below. When an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the companion, the ranger may spend a Free Reaction to have the companion make an opportunity attack. Both the ranger and the companion can make opportunity attacks the same turn. Beast Strike - Ranger Feature 1 Attack - Primal, Beast Free Action - Melee Beast - H vs Arm.
