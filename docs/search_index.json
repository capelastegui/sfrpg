Class Skills Perception 11.2 Minion Monsters Unlike most characters, minions do not have a HP value - do not keep track of damage done to minions. Instead, use the following: Minions have a damage threshold value. Whenever a minion receives damage equal or greater than their damage threshold, they are automatically incapacitated. If a character damages a minion multiple times in the same turn (e.g. with several weak attacks) and the total damage that turn exceeds the minions damage threshold, the minion is also automatically incapacitated. A minion that takes damage below their damage threshold is knocked prone instead. Prone minions that are targeted by an attack or take any damage are automatically incapacitated. A minion that starts their turn Prone must make a saving throw - on a failed save, they can take no actions that turn. In addition, most minions have Partial Vulnerability (Melee or Ranged), included in their stats. 11.2.1 Minion Races, Heroic Humanoid Level 1 Kobold Minion Small - Humanoid Movement 6 Base Stats Def H D E 0 4 4 1 HP Hi 7 Mid 6 Low 5 Resistances Partial Vuln.
